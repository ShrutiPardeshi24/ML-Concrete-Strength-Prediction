**Concrete Strength Prediction**
This dataset contains experimental data on the compressive strength of concrete, a critical property in structural engineering. It’s commonly used to model and predict how different ingredient combinations affect the final strength of concrete mixtures.

**Problem Statement**

To build a regression model that predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and age. This can help optimize mix designs for construction projects, reduce costs, and improve safety.

**Features**

Data loading and exploration

Data visualization

Preprocessing and feature scaling
