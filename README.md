**Concrete Strength Prediction**
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and age using various machine learning models.

**Problem Statement**

Predict the compressive strength of concrete using its composition (cement, slag, ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate) and age.

**Features**

Data loading and exploration

Data visualization

Preprocessing and feature scaling

Model training and evaluation using:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor

Model comparison and performance metrics

**Dataset**

The dataset should be in CSV format and contain the following columns:

cement
slag
ash
water
superplastic
coarseagg
fineagg
age
strength
